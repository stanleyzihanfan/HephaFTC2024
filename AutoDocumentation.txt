This is the documentation for the AutoSample program functions
Note that this is a work in progress.

The drive function:
Name: mecanumDrive
Description: Moves the drive base of robot
Usage: mecanumDrive(drive, strafe, twist, apply)
drive is a double value between -1.0 and 1.0, negative corresponds to forward, positive corresponds to backward
strafe is a double value between -1.0 and 1.0, negative corresponds to left, positive corresponds to right
twist is a double value between -1.0 and 1.0, negative corresponds to counter-clockwise(left), positive corresponds to clockwise(right)
apply is a boolean value, true applies the movement values to the robot directly, false only returns a double list of motor speeds.

The Wait function:
Name: waitForTime
Description: Uses runtime to make the program pause for a specified amount of seconds.
Usage: waitForTime(seconds)
seconds is the double value of the amount of time to wait in seconds.

The Arm Position function:
Name: armToPosition
Description: Moves the arm motor, wrist servo, and intake servo.
Usage: armToPosition(arm, wristPos, intakeSpeed)
arm is position of arm motor
wristPos is position of wrist(the function will reset the values if they are too big/too small to prevent it from jamming into the arm and breaking)
intakeSpeed is speed of intake
All of the servos only accept a values between 0 and 1.
The encoder for the motor gets larger the more you rotate(it dosn't reset to 0 unless you do it in the code)
The motor value is an int.
